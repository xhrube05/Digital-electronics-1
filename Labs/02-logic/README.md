### Karnaugh maps
#### B equals A
![Equals](Images/equals.png)
#### B is greater than A
![Greater](Images/greater.png)
#### B is less than A

## 3. 4-bit binary comparator
### VHDL architecture (`design.vhd`)
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of comparator_2bit is
begin
    B_less_A_o   	<= '1' when (b_i < a_i) else '0';
    B_greater_A_o   <= '1' when (b_i > a_i) else '0';
    B_equals_A_o  	<= '1' when (b_i = a_i) else '0';

end architecture Behavioral;
```

### VHDL stimulus process (`testbench.vhd`)
